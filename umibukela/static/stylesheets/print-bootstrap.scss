   By default, when printing a Bootstrap page the browser thinks the page is
   about the size of a mobile device, and so Bootstrap's grid system
   acts in "sm" or "xs" mode. It's hard to tell the browser otherwise. So, we
   adjust bootstrap so that no matter what, the "sm", "md" and "lg" grid sizes
   still apply and don't collapse.
